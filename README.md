## Description of the Project

This project is a two way marketplace app for dog lovers where dog breeders can advertising puppies being sold and Buyers will see dog listings and and be able to communicate to the breeder.

### Problem definition and purpose

The application was created for the sole purpose of promoting the pure bred pedigree dog so you won't find any crossbred in this website. In the table below is a comparison between a pure bred pedigree dog vs cross breeds.<br/>
| Dog | Pure Bred Pedigree Dog | Cross Breeds |
| :------- | :------------------------: | :-------------- |
| |Both parents are of the same breed.| A Dog resulting from the deliberate mating of two unrelated breed types.|
|| The breed is recognised by the Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) or one of its Affiliates.| A Dog resulting from an accidental or intentional mating of two different breed types.|
|| The dog's breeders are registered to breed puppies.| A Dog resulting from the mating of one pedigree or pure bred parent and one cross bred or designer bred dog.|
|| The parents of any puppies are registered with the ANKC or one of its affiliates to be bred from | A Cross Breed dog has not been bred by a registered breeder|
|| It has a pedigree showing at least 3 generations of parentage |A Cross Breed dog is not pure bred or pedigree.| <br/>

Disadvantages of Cross breeds are the following: <br>

- difficulty in predicting temperament<br/>
- Hard to Predict Adult Size
- Potential for High Risk Deliveries
- Strong Chance for Congenital Health Issues
- May Be More Expensive Than a Purebred<br/>

According to Australian Companion Animal Council, Australia has one of the highest rates of dog ownership in the world, despite a small decline in recent years. About 2.8 million households have at least one dog. Figures on cross breed dogs are not centralised but research estimates sales of cross bred dogs surpassed pure bred pedigree.<br/>

Adding a dog to the family is a huge step because it involves 10 to 15 years of commitment and the final choice betwenn a pedigree dog or a designer dog is up to you.<br/>

In this app, we aim to:<br/>

- assure buyers that they will have a good experience and confidence of all puppies being sold will adhere to the Australian National Kennel Council regulations.
- That dog breeders needs to be registered and approved by Australian National Kennel Council by proof of a valid breeder prefix Identification.
